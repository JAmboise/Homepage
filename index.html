        <p class="bio">Hi there! My name is Jude, and I'm currently diving headfirst into the world of software
            development. While I have an associate's degree in business management under my belt, I discovered a passion
            for creating things with code, leading me to this exciting new path.<br>
            Outside of the world of programming, you might find me exploring new hiking trails, tinkering with
            electronics, or getting lost in a good book (preferably sci-fi or fantasy!). However, my current obsession,
            without a doubt, is JavaScript. I'm currently immersing myself in a JavaScript class, eager to unlock its
            potential and build innovative applications.</p>

        <p class="bio">I believe software development is a journey of continuous learning, and I'm always looking for
            new challenges and opportunities to grow. This website is not only a space for me to showcase my projects,
            but also a personal journal of my learning journey.</p>
